    <blockquote data-username="knights">The main reason currently for the multi-positional player is so that teams can carry another reliever.: some American league teams are playing with a four-man bench.</blockquote>I have noticed this also. Some analysts on the games I have seen have commented on the 13 P and 12 position player rosters. And this in a league that uses 9 hitters with the DH!!.<br/><br/>About the offense I believe that most ball parks have been moving fences in or adjusting in some way to get more offense. This is probably part of the reason for the higher offensive numbers we are seeing.
