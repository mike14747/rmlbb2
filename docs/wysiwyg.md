It seems like the following packages will need to be installed:

-   react-draft-wysiwyg (the React wrapper for draft-js)
-   draft-js
-   draftjs-to-html (used to convert the draft-js state to html for database storage)
-   html-to-draftjs (used to convert html into draft-js state... eg: when someone is editing a post)

```bash
npm i react-draft-wysiwyg draft-js draftjs-to-html html-to-draftjs
```
